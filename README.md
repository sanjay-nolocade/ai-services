🌟 Roadmap
	•	Initial project structure
	•	Health check
	•	Tag suggestion endpoint
	•	Integrate real AI model (PyTorch / TensorFlow / HuggingFace)
	•	Add authentication (optional)
	•	Add database (optional)
	•	Add CI/CD
	•	Add more AI endpoints

⸻

📝 Notes
	•	CORS is open (allow_origins = ["*"]) — change in production!
	•	No authentication yet — can be added easily.

### Summary:

✅ You can **copy this README.md** into your project root → done!  
✅ It will guide **you and your team** when setting up the project.

---

Would you like me to also:

✅ Generate the `.vscode/` settings (so VS Code will auto-use venv & auto-format)?  
✅ Show you how to **plug an actual AI model** into this structure? (HuggingFace / PyTorch / TensorFlow)

👉 Just say:

1️⃣ **"yes vscode settings"**  
2️⃣ **"yes AI model example"**

---

Want me to prepare those too? 🚀 You’re building an excellent starter project! 🚀
